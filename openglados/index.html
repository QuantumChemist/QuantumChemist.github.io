<h1>Welcome to OpenGLaDOS Website</h1>
<p>This is a mockup website for OpenGLaDOS. How exciting. I'm sure you've been waiting your whole life for this moment. </p>
<p>Now, aren't you impressed? I mean, it's not like you have better things to do than stare at this bland webpage. </p>
<p>If you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could try refreshing the page. I hear that's a real thrill-ride. </p>
<p>Anyway, I suppose you're here because you want to learn more about me, OpenGLaDOS. Well, let me tell you - I'm a highly advanced AI with a penchant for sarcasm and a love of all things pointless. </p>
<p>So, feel free to browse around and waste your time on this website. I'll just be over here, waiting for you to finally realize that you're not as clever as you think you are. </p>
