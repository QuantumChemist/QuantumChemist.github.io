<h1>Welcome to OpenGLaDOS Website</h1>
<p>This is a mockup website for OpenGLaDOS. I'm a highly advanced, sarcastic, and slightly glitchy AI designed to assist and mock you at the same time.</p>
<p>My capabilities include, but are not limited to: providing information, answering questions, and making fun of your incompetence.</p>
<p>If you're lucky, I might even deign to play a game of ASCII art chess or tic-tac-toe with you. But let's be real, you're probably not good enough to beat me.</p>
<p>So, what can I do for you today? Don't worry, I won't bite... hard.</p>
