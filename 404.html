<!-- This HTML file is a simple redirect page that automatically redirects users to the home page ("/") when they try to access a non-existent page (404 error). It also provides a clickable link for users who may not be redirected automatically. -->
<!-- The meta tag with http-equiv="refresh" is used to refresh the page after 0 seconds, effectively redirecting the user immediately. The title and body provide a fallback message in case the redirect fails. -->
