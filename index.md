Hi, I'm [Christina Ertural](https://g.co/kgs/Bi3Bdb), an active scientist in the theoretical and solid-state chemistry community, currently PostDoc in materials chemistry and materials informatics at [BAM](https://www.bam.de/) in Berlin in the junior group of [Dr. Janine George](https://jageo.github.io/about_group/) and former [LOBSTER](http://www.cohp.de/) developer. Scroll down for more information about me and my research.
	
[![Battery](https://quantumchemist.github.io/utils/bat.png)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c03349) 

My research interests involve different areas of theoretical, quantum and computational chemistry such as the development and improvement of [well-established](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9RA05190B) and [innovative](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c00718) methods. Another important aspect in my research is the application of different quantum chemical approaches to solid-state and materials chemistry concerning compounds like [Zintl phases](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9RA05190B), especially [thermoelectrical materials](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25822), [cathode and anode materials](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c03349) for battery technology or [phase-change materials](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202115778).

My [Dissertation](https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/849333) (in German) 
#### On the electronic structure of solid-state functional materials and their characterization using local bonding indicators 
is now available online.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

The final element.
