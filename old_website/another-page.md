> But you need a job to get experience.
> But AI is replacing many entry-level experience-gaining jobs.
> But companies still want humans with experience that a this rate will soon no longer exist.
> But they won't pay for the experience they demand.
> And if you're overqualified, you're unemployable.
> But if you're underqualified, you're also unemployable.
